Quant++
========

A C++ quantitative trading framework. 

Currently this is a very amateur project I have started to teach myself basic
concepts of quantitative finance.  Use code at your own risk as currently I
don't fully understand what I am doing yet and this is *very* alpha code.

This code requires the boost libraries. http://www.boost.org/ 

That said, one day I hope this morphs into an open source industry standard
framework. :)
